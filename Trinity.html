<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
 </p> <p>Trinity is an awesome campus located in the heart of San Antonio. Within 15 minutes is the riverwalk, La Contera, the alamo, and the San Antonio Spurs! Besides being so close to everthing cool in San Antonio, Trinity is a top notch school. The education here is world class and will certainly help us out in our future. Last but not least, Trinity's network is all over the world. You never know who knows who here, so the career opportunities are limitless!</p>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the fountain and the new football field. The fountain during the fall and spring is the best spot to relax, do homework, or catch up with friends. The new football field is also a great spot on campus. The new turf looks amazing and is a quick walk from anywhere on campus. </p></br>

<p>I chose Trinity University because I wanted a world class education while also being close to home. I am only 1 hour from Austin and 10 minutes from my grandmother's house, so I get the best of both worlds here. </p>
<p>I am thinking of majoring in Biochemistry because I aspire to go to medical school. Attached below is the link to the biology department at Trinity.</p>
